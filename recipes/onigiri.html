        <h3>Japanese rice balls.</h3>
        <p>Onigiri are Japanese rice balls that come in many shapes and sizes. They can be filled or unfilled</p>
        <p>The general idea is to have a portable, ready to eat bowl of rice.</p>
        <p></p>

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 and a half cups Japanese short grain rice</li>
                <li>1 and two thirds cups of cold water</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Unseasoned nori</li>

            <h4>Recipe directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash and cook the rice in a rice cooker.</li>
                <li>Cut the nori into thirds either with scissors or creasing and tearing the nori.</li>
                <li>Prepare a medium bowl of water and a small bowl of salt.</li>
                <li>When the rice is done, fluff it and transfer it to a bowl to cool. Keep the bowl covered with a damp towel to keep the rice from drying out.</li>
                <li>When the rice has cooled enough to handle, wet your hands in the bowl of water and dip your index finger into the bowl of salt.</li>
                <li>Rub the salt into both hands and then scoop a sixth of the rice into one hand.</li>
                <li>Curl your fingers up and over the rice, then use your index and middle fingers on your free hand to shape the rice into a triangle.</li>
                <li>Roll the rice ball on your hand onto another side and repeat until the triangle has equal sides.</li>
                <li>Place a strip of nori centered on the rice and then wrap each side of the nori around the triangle and under the base.</li>
            </ol>
