            <ol>
                <li>Follow the instructions on your concentrated mentsuyu bottle for the correct dilution ratio for noodle soup broth.</li>
                <li>In a meduim saucepan, combine the water, mantsuyu and mirin. Bring it to a simmer over meduim heat. Once simmering, remove the pot from the heat. Cover with a lid and set aside</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. When the water comes to a full boil, add 2 servings udon noodles and cook according to the pacage instructions.</li>
                <li>Using chopsticks, stir the noodles so they don't stick to the bottom of the pot.</li>
                <li>When the noodles are done cooking, drain them in a colander and cool under cold running water</li>
                <li>Once the noodles are cool enough to touch, use your hands to rince them under the cold running water to remove the starch and give them a firm texture. Then switch to hot running water to warm up the noodles.</li>
                <li>Serve the udon noodles in individual bowls. Pour the hot broth over the noodles and top with chopped green onion.</li>
